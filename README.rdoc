== Journal - App Demo

This is my first completed CRUD appliation, which allows the simple recording of journal entries. Users can create
an account, enter projects, and create entries under each project. The application uses SQlite and Twitter Bootstrap,
as well as RSpec tests at model, controller, and integration levels.

A live version of this application can be found at http://stasjournal.herokuapp.com.
